    About
    </h1> 
      <p> Waste is a severe problem in t8he modern world due to its quantity and diversity and its impact on the state of the natural environment. Unfortunately, every day a human's actions have a more and more negative effect on the state of the natural environment. </p>
                              
<p> My posters represent the reality of pollution on earth. The first poster presents waste from the world of technology. The next is about excessive use of plastic. The third claim is clothes that are plastic. The fourth is about the unhealthy process of creating junk food. Finally, the last one shows the earth where he asks 'WILL THERE BE FUTURE?'</>
                              
<p> To create posters, I used photoshop, illustrator, and a soft glitch app to make the posters. While designing, I was inspired mainly by light colors, movement, and 3D effects. Therefore, I used glitch art, strong contrast, and blending. </p>
                              
<p> Ecology is a response to the growing threat to broadly understood life and care for the natural environment. A cleaner environment and a longer life are the most important reasons why we as a community should take small steps in helping the planet. </p>
